# Palette-Survey
Created: March 2017

This was simply an application to help me survey around campus for an app idea I had. 
The survey required the user to capture a photo of their clothes, and then the application
would analyze their attire and give a palette of up to eight potential colors quantized from 
the picture. The user would then select the top three best matches, then rate how accurate they felt 
the colors were overall. Additionally, the user would be asked to rate if they felt the colors
determined were too dark, too light or just fine. Finally, any additional input could be given.
